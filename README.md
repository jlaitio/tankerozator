* Tankerozator

Converts English to pseudo-phonetic "tankero" English for native Finnish speakers. Works by translating English to IPA using https://github.com/mphilli/English-to-IPA (library hardcopied here for easier Lambda packaging) and then IPA to tankero-English using simple character substitution.
